# Data Mining 

Welcome to my Data Mining repository! This repository is dedicated to various assignments that explore different data mining techniques and algorithms as I progress in my studies.

## Repository Structure

- **Practical1**: Contains the first assignment focused on clustering techniques.
- **Practical2**: Contains the second assignment exploring classification methods.

## Overview

This repository showcases the implementation and evaluation of various data mining algorithms, including but not limited to:

- K-means clustering
- Hierarchical agglomerative clustering
- DBSCAN clustering
- Decision tree classification
- Ensemble methods

## Installation

To run the notebooks, you will need the following Python libraries:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
